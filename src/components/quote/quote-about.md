I enjoy writing and performing a variety of styles, and my forte is rock & metal. I am currently an active member of UK Metal band 'Harbinger', that I have toured extensively with across Europe. I've been teaching now for over a decade and have tons of knowledge and experience that I can use to make sure you progress on the guitar.
