We recruited Charlie as a session player during a time of transition for our band and he was exactly what we needed and more.

From rehearsal etiquette to on-stage charisma - he was and is the epitome of professionalism when it comes to session playing. His ability on the guitar is incredible and unquestionable, with a work-ethic to match, but beyond that, he is a great human being, and someone who I now consider to be a good friend.
